# ChemPhoPro-2.0
Welcome to the ChemPhoPro 2.0 repository!
This contains all of the code that was used to create this web application, from the app.py to the database population file (still in progress). 

To test the application:
Copy all the files such that the app.py and database (.db) file (download link below) are in the root of the directory alongside the static and template folders.
please note: the Magpipe files are there for a database creation file which is currently still being made.
